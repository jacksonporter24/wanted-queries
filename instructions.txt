Yes, the 2 high level, 2 low level, and 1 smoke/sanity test are with Trello. 

To review: The smoke/sanity test is an overview of the whole site. Are there any glaring or bugs that happen when just exploring the site? 

High level tests are for broad tests (ex. Does the buttons in the nav bar take me to the correct page?). 

Low level tests are for testing specific code functionality (ex. Does clicking on the search bar and entering an item populate the expected results?).
